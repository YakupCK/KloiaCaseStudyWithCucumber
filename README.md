Notes
● The project should be shared in a git repository
● Page Object Model (POM) approach should be used
● You can use any tool stack (Eg: Java, Ruby, Python etc.) except record & play
● Each execution should generate a HTML report
● Project structure can be suitable for different browsers
● README.md file should be added
● Project can be run on the Command line

I also provided some video recordings.
 In two of them, I explained my framework briefly
 In the others, I run my code and recorded it
 to show how the codes are running
